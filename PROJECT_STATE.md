# Project State

> Fast orientation only. Keep this page short, factual, and current. The underlying briefs, reports, design, decisions, roadmap, and repository remain the real sources of truth.

## Project

- **Name:** Household Dashboard v2
- **One-line concept:** A phone-first shared household system for recurring responsibilities, personal work, and progressively granted independence.
- **Activation status:** Active
- **Current milestone:** First Useful Release
- **Primary platform/environment:** Responsive mobile/desktop web; local/LAN development plus a provider-neutral secure single-host release target
- **Primary interfaces:** Browser UI, versioned JSON API, household WebSocket synchronization, operator CLI commands
- **Engine/framework:** Node.js 24, TypeScript, React/Vite, Fastify, SQLite (`better-sqlite3`)
- **Repository status:** Existing
- **Version control:** Active
- **Integration branch:** `main`
- **Remote / PR workflow:** GitHub `origin` (`gabe-kai/HouseholdDashboardV2`); brief branches and pull requests
- **External project board:** None

## Current focus

Architecture has drafted `P0-004B r1 - Group-backed Morning Routine` against merged P0-004A. The next step is Engineering's consolidated readiness review of that exact revision; implementation has not started.

## Internal work status

| Work | Revision | State | Current team | Branch / PR | Waiting on |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-001 - Shared Morning Routine | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #1 | Product acceptance/evaluation |
| P0-002 - Authenticated Household Authority | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | `brief/p0-002-authenticated-household-authority` | Product evaluation; future hosted release candidates require the hosted smoke/evidence gate |
| P0-003 - Regression Safety and Contract Hardening | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #6 | Product evaluation; optional required-check configuration |
| P0-004A - People & Groups UX Completion | r3 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #8 | Product phone evaluation |
| P0-004B - Group-backed Morning Routine | r1 | IN REVIEW | Engineering readiness | Not started; planned `brief/p0-004b-group-backed-morning-routine` | Consolidated readiness review against r1 |

Suggested states: DRAFT, IN REVIEW, BLOCKED, ESCALATED, READY, IMPLEMENTING, IMPLEMENTED, FIX REQUIRED, ACCEPTED, PRODUCT DECISION.

This table is the short repository-side coordination index. An external project board, if used, is a human-facing visibility layer and may use simpler card states.

## Recently completed

- P0-001 r1 was implemented, technically accepted by Architecture, and merged to `main` through PR #1.
- The P0-001 implementation provides a responsive Morning Routine evaluation build with immutable structural history, optimistic durable checklist intent, and household-scoped synchronization.
- P0-002 r1 added authenticated household authority, personal layers/proposals, scoped personal tasks, and hosted-operability evidence; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-10.
- P0-003 r1 added protected-behavior traceability, route-policy completeness, focused regression evidence, local PR/RC validation tiers, and a successful GitHub Actions PR gate; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-10.
- P0-004A r3 established focused People & Groups states, fixture-free normal bootstrap, canonical opt-in demo fixtures, and provenance-safe cleanup; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-11 and it was merged through PR #8.

## Known blockers

- None. Required-check branch protection is an optional external Project Lead setting and is not yet asserted as configured.

## Next Project Lead decision

- Product evaluation of P0-004A may continue independently. No hosted deployment or new Project Lead decision is required before local P0-004B readiness/implementation.

## Next likely handoff

Architecture hands `P0-004B r1` to Engineering for one consolidated repository-grounded readiness review. Engineering should not implement until Architecture responds to that review.

## Notes for all teams

- `TBD` is allowed. Resolve only what blocks the next meaningful usable slice.
- Check `DECISIONS.md` before inventing a new convention.
- Name brief revision numbers in handoffs.
- Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for repository activation and branch/commit/PR policy.
- `ACCEPTED` means technical brief acceptance; user/product acceptance is separate.
- The Studio Coordinator keeps this summary synchronized with confirmed project state.
