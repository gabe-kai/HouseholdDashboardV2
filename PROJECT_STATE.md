# Project State

> Fast orientation only. Keep this page short, factual, and current. The underlying briefs, reports, design, decisions, roadmap, and repository remain the real sources of truth.

## Project

- **Name:** Household Dashboard v2
- **One-line concept:** A phone-first shared household system for recurring responsibilities, personal work, and progressively granted independence.
- **Activation status:** Active
- **Current milestone:** First Useful Release
- **Primary platform/environment:** Responsive mobile/desktop web; local/LAN development plus a provider-neutral secure single-host release target
- **Primary interfaces:** Browser UI, versioned JSON API, household WebSocket synchronization, operator CLI commands
- **Engine/framework:** Node.js 24, TypeScript, React/Vite, Fastify, SQLite (`better-sqlite3`)
- **Repository status:** Existing
- **Version control:** Active
- **Integration branch:** `main`
- **Remote / PR workflow:** GitHub `origin` (`gabe-kai/HouseholdDashboardV2`); brief branches and pull requests
- **External project board:** None

## Current focus

**P0-007B r1 - Assignment Patterns & Scheduled Work** is **IMPLEMENTED** (local PR/RC green), based on integrated `main` **51322e0** (P0-007A merge PR #15). Authoritative brief: `briefs/p0-007b-assignment-patterns-scheduled-work.md`; D-038-D-040 define the accepted contract. Build evidence: `reports/P0-007B-r1-build-report.md`. Card **Understand whose turn it is, including deep-clean days** is **In Progress**. C remains LIKELY NEXT under the supplied Design proposal.

## Internal work status

| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-001 - Shared Morning Routine | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #1 | Product acceptance/evaluation |
| P0-002 - Authenticated Household Authority | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | `brief/p0-002-authenticated-household-authority` | Product evaluation; future hosted release candidates require the hosted smoke/evidence gate |
| P0-003 - Regression Safety and Contract Hardening | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #6 | Product evaluation; optional required-check configuration |
| P0-004A - People & Groups UX Completion | r3 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #8 | Product phone evaluation |
| P0-004B - Group-backed Morning Routine | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` via PR #9 | Product evaluation |
| P0-005 - Cohesive Routine Management | r3 | ACCEPTED | Completed | Merged to `main` via PR #11 | P0-006 follow-up carries Product evaluation findings |
| P0-006A - Calm Household Experience Foundation | r2 | ACCEPTED | Completed | Merged to `main` at `7cba3a6` via PR #12 | None; Project Lead evaluation accepted |
| P0-006B - Contextual Routine Applicability | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead/Product | Merged to `main` at `de552ab` | Evaluate the contextual routine experience |
| P0-006C - Household Profiles and Useful History | r1 | ACCEPTED | Project Lead evaluation | Merged to `main` at `409d147` via PR #14 | Product acceptance remains separate |
| P0-007A - Household Responsibility Foundation | r1 | ACCEPTED | Completed foundation | Merged to `main` at `51322e0` via PR #15 | None for A; Design carries presentation feedback to C |
| P0-007B - Assignment Patterns & Scheduled Work | r1 | IMPLEMENTED | Engineering | `brief/p0-007b-assignment-patterns-scheduled-work` | Architecture technical acceptance |

Suggested states: DRAFT, IN REVIEW, BLOCKED, ESCALATED, READY, IMPLEMENTING, IMPLEMENTED, FIX REQUIRED, ACCEPTED, PRODUCT DECISION.

This table is the short repository-side coordination index. An external project board, if used, is a human-facing visibility layer and may use simpler card states.

## Recently completed

- P0-001 r1 was implemented, technically accepted by Architecture, and merged to `main` through PR #1.
- The P0-001 implementation provides a responsive Morning Routine evaluation build with immutable structural history, optimistic durable checklist intent, and household-scoped synchronization.
- P0-002 r1 added authenticated household authority, personal layers/proposals, scoped personal tasks, and hosted-operability evidence; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-10.
- P0-003 r1 added protected-behavior traceability, route-policy completeness, focused regression evidence, local PR/RC validation tiers, and a successful GitHub Actions PR gate; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-10.
- P0-004A r3 established focused People & Groups states, fixture-free normal bootstrap, canonical opt-in demo fixtures, and provenance-safe cleanup; Architecture technically accepted it on 2026-09-11 and it was merged through PR #8.
- P0-004B r1 added dated group-backed Morning Routine participation and was technically accepted after correction `ac41538`, then merged through PR #9.
- P0-005 r1/r2 established multiple routines and first-action locks; r2 implementation is `297b2fd`, merged to `main` at `5376b51`, and technically accepted. Product evaluation prompted r3's full routine lifecycle, current-plan ranges, and shared visual/navigation foundation.
- P0-005 r3 completed the routine lifecycle and Calm Household shell, was technically accepted after AT6 and long-lived-database receipt corrections, and merged through PR #11 at `31aad37`.
- P0-006A r2 completed the responsive Plan shell, focused editors, saved navigation, quiet feedback, and step ordering; required local evidence was closed and Architecture accepted it. The Project Lead then reviewed screenshots, tested, and reported satisfaction. A and B planning are integrated at `7cba3a6` via PR #12, including the A toast/CI correction.
- P0-006B r1 contextual applicability and school calendar were technically accepted after AT9 rollback and AT10/AT11 browser evidence closed at `8421b31`, then merged through PR #13 at `de552ab`. The Project Lead reported successful school-year/exception setup and chose to continue the approved proposal with C.

- P0-006C r1 profiles, saved family order, read-only summarized History and generation-fenced activity reset were technically accepted after correction `e8a93d5`, then merged via PR #14 at `409d147`.
- P0-007A r1 was technically accepted at `bb21d74`, recorded in `7539fd0`, and merged via PR #15 at `51322e0`. The Project Lead confirmed merge/cleanup; the supplied Design proposal accepts A as the foundation and requests B next, preserving C's presentation feedback.

## Known blockers

- No known blocker to B implementation evidence. Architecture technical acceptance waits on the Build Report and local PR/RC gates. Required-check branch protection remains an external Project Lead setting.

## Next Project Lead decision

- Review Engineering Build Report `reports/P0-007B-r1-build-report.md`, commit when ready, and send Architecture the technical-acceptance handoff. Project Lead manages Git; no deployment is required for this slice.

## Next likely handoff

Architecture reviews **P0-007B revision 1** evidence. Card **Understand whose turn it is, including deep-clean days** stays **In Progress** until technical acceptance. C remains LIKELY NEXT.

## Notes for all teams

- `TBD` is allowed. Resolve only what blocks the next meaningful usable slice.
- Check `DECISIONS.md` before inventing a new convention.
- Name brief revision numbers in handoffs.
- Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for repository activation and branch/commit/PR policy.
- `ACCEPTED` means technical brief acceptance; user/product acceptance is separate.
- The Studio Coordinator keeps this summary synchronized with confirmed project state.
